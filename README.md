## 🔹 Project Focus

This project demonstrates **SOC automation and analyst-style decision-making**:

- 🎟️ **Automated Ticketing & Alerts** – Generates daily tickets in a format similar to Jira and ServiceNow. Simulates real incident intake and workflow management.  
- 🚨 **Escalation & Prioritization** – Automatically classifies alerts as High 🔴, Medium 🟠, or Low 🟢, helping analysts focus on critical incidents first.  
- 📈 **Analytics & Visualization** – Counts alerts, calculates XP points for gamification, and generates severity charts 📊 to visualize trends over time.  
- 🔍 **Data Analysis** – Mimics SOC/IR analyst techniques by identifying patterns, highlighting recurring issues, and prioritizing incidents for investigation.  
- ⚙️ **Automation** – Fully automated via GitHub Actions to simulate daily SOC activity without manual intervention.
